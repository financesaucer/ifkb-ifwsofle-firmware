*** ⚠️ Note: These files are mainly backups for my personal use. It's generally not recommended to trust compiled firmware from unknown sources. If possible, download the official firmware directly from the IFKB User Manual. The same applies for the firmware files, I strongly suggest you download them from the original source as well... ***
